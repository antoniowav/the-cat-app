## Comments

The app has uses an envinroment variable for the API KEY which is hidden on Github.

I have chosen to go with a different layout for the header since I liked it more.
All the functionalities are still there.

The filter functionality is made by using a [category] page. I have decided to use this method to save some time and not have to call the API every time a filter is selected.
Instead, I preferred to redirect to a dedicated page called "category".
